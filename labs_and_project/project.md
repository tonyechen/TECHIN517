# TECHIN 517 Spring 2026 Class Project

## Learning Objectives

- Gain experience using cutting edge techniques for robot learning
- Develop a smart, general robot application for an area of robotics your team is passionate about: healthcare, agriculture, home, food, manufacturing, etc.


## Project Requirements

- Develop a "general robotics" application for bi-manual SO101 robot arms
- Incorporate machine learning, computer vision, and classical techniques to accomplish your application
- Collect quantitative metrics on your system's performance


## TODO

- Join a team
- Choose a concept or category of tasks to iterate on
- Review existing demos and research online
- Discuss application with teaching team
- Begin with the most basic version of your application
    - For example: If your application is to fold clothes, start by folding a hand towel once
- Continue developing features, gathering training data, and training models to increase the robustness of your system
- Present your progress to the class
- Incorporate feedback
- Present your final results

**Presentations**

- Teaching team check-in:
    - Discuss your application
    - Present your research
    - Present an initial development plan:
        - How are you going to start?
        - How far would you like to get before the end of the quarter?
        - How do you plan to address the evaluation considerations?
- In-class presentation 1:
    - Present your plan
    - Train the most basic version of your application  
    - Show a demo video of progress so far
    - Present evidence of what each team member has done so far
    - Explain what each team member will do next
    - Describe your goals for the next 2 presentation
- In-class presentation 2:
    - Demonstrate progress based on feedback from the first presentation
    - Show a demo video of progress so far
    - Present evidence of what each team member has done so far
    - Explain what each team member will do next
    - Describe your goal for the final presentation
- Final presentation:
    - Perform a live demo
    - Present your results
    - Explain how you handled challenges and improved your system
    - Address the evaluation considerations below


## Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on the following priorities:
1. Does your system meet the project requirements?
2. Can your system preform your application?
3. Can it perform the application safely?
    - Does it avoid harming people?
    - Does it avoid damaging the robot?
    - Does it avoid damaging the environment and any objects it interacts with?
4. Is it robust?
    - Can it perform the application multiple times?
    - What is the success rate?
    - How long can your system operate before it needs to be reset or maintained?
5. How well does it generalize?
    - Does your application work with related objects?
    - Does it work in different lighting conditions?
    - What happens if there are random objects in the scene?
    - Does your application work in related environments?


## Final Deliverables

- A short video demo of your robot performing its application
- Upload your model(s) to Huggingface
- Github repo containing the following:
    - A .devcontainer with a Dockerfile and devcontainer.json purpose made for your project and your dependencies  
    Theorhetically, anyone who downloads your repo should be able to use your robot using your container environment
    - All of your customized code required to use the robot
    - Contributions from all team members
    - A LICENSE file that complies with all dependencies' licenses
    - A README.md file with:
        - A short explanation of your project
        - A link to your video demo
        - Setup instructions, including installation instructions of any dependencies, and a link to download your pre-trained model(s)
        - Usage instructions
- Return all materials


## FAQ

**Q:** What methods should we focus on? (VLA, classical motion planning, RL)?  
**A:** Start by training a demo using the tutorial from lerobot.  
Afterwards you may use any methods necessary.  
The lab schedule will not train you on RL until near the end of the quarter, but you are always welcome to work ahead.

**Q:** We couldn't get enough time with the arms to complete our project, can we still get the full grade?  
**A:** You need to manage your time to complete on-time.  
Please be considerate to your fellow class-mates and use the class spreadsheet to schedule time with the 5090 desktops.  
Consider training your models on your personal devices overnight to reduce reliance on school resources.  

**Q:** Do we have to use 2 arms?  
**A:** Your project must meet all project requirements.

**Q:** Can we change the hardware?  
**A:** Multiple teams need to share these robot arms.  
Therefore, you can potentially add hardware and external tools if your project requires.  
You must be able to rapidly return the robot to its base configuration to allow other teams to use it.


## Resources

[Physical Intelligence's Website](https://www.pi.website/)  
[Physical Intelligence's YouTube Chanel](https://www.youtube.com/@PhysicalIntelligence/videos)  
Physical Intelligence (pi) is a cutting edge, YC-backed, startup developing VLA models for general robotics.  
Their YouTube chanel features many impressive demos that are similar to the goal of this project.  
Given that they have far more resources, you are not expected to be able to replicate their results fully, but their work can still serve as inspiration to help you scope your project.

[NVIDIA Isaac GR00T](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/gr00t)  
[Actually useful GR00T tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV3OXZIciyneoSHLTuS42_rvXXIj6wDQC)  
GR00T is NVIDIA's VLA model for general robotics.  
It has integrations with their other systems like Isaac Lab, Cosmos, and Isaac ROS.  
Their documentation is lacking and frustrating, so it is recommended to begin with a different VLA model until your requirements necessitate GR00T's features.
